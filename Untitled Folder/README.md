Assignment 1
Median and Average filtering for .ppm images.
Task: Given a .ppm image and a number of cores to run on, write a parallel algorithm using 
      MPI (message passing interface) to perform a median and average filter on the image.

Assignment 3
Parrallelized Genetic Algorithm for .ppm images.
Taks: Given a serial genetic algorithm, make it parallelizable using OpenMP (multicore CPU), then using OpenACC (GPU).
Bonus Task: Devise a more efficient genetic algortihm that creates a more pleasing image in less time. 
            Please see mm_ultron_bonus_efficient.gif. All code with *bonus.c suffix is for this bonus task.
